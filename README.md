# Sentiment-Analysis

🚀 **Sentiment Analysis of Mobile Legends Reviews on Google Play Store 🎮**  

In today's data-driven era, understanding user sentiment is crucial for enhancing user experience. I've recently completed a project analyzing thousands of user reviews for Mobile Legends, one of the most popular mobile games. 📊  

🔧 **Tools & Technologies Used:**  
- Programming Language: Python 🐍  
- NLP Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn, nltk  
- Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, WordCloud  
- Deep Learning Models: LSTM, BiLSTM, and GRU  

🔍 **Key Insights:**  
- BiLSTM delivered the best performance with an accuracy of 88%, a precision of 0.85 (for negative class), and a high recall, along with the lowest classification errors compared to LSTM and GRU.  
- LSTM achieved comparable performance to BiLSTM but had higher false negative rates.  
- GRU showed the lowest performance with an accuracy of 82% and the highest classification errors (5,465 false positives and 5,353 false negatives).  
- BiLSTM stood out by capturing information from both forward and backward directions, making it the best choice for text classification tasks requiring deep contextual understanding.  

💡 **Why does this matter?**  
By analyzing user feedback, developers can gain actionable insights to enhance game features, improve user satisfaction, and increase player engagement.  

🚀 I'm excited to apply these insights to future NLP projects and continue exploring the power of data science in the gaming industry!
